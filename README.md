# CSV Reports Expansion Tool

## Purpose
This is a script that is meant to make the CSV reports generated by ArchivesSpace more readable in some scenarios.

The CSV reports generated by ArchivesSpace in most cases show linked records as a list of JSON objects. This looks something like the following.

[{"name":"Halpern, Elizabeth","function":"creator","role":null},{"name":"Halpern, Elizabeth","function":"subject","role":null}]

This tool creates a separate row for each JSON object in the list and makes a new column for each key in the JSON object. This should allow for increased sorting ability.

## Example
The following is an example of how this would look for one row of report data.

### Before
|accession_number|record_title|deaccessions|names|
|---|---|---|---|
|*2010M-1|Annotation by A. L. (Alfred Leslie) Rowse on clipping|[{"description":"It's gone, man.","notification_sent":"Yes","date":"2018-04-06","extent":"0.00 "}]|[{"name":"Halpern, Elizabeth","function":"creator","role":null},{"name":"Halpern, Elizabeth","function":"subject","role":null}]|

### After
|accession_number|record_title|deaccessions_date|deaccessions_notification_sent|deaccessions_extent|deaccessions_description|names_name|names_function|names_role|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|*2010M-1|Annotation by A. L. (Alfred Leslie) Rowse on clipping|4/6/2018|Yes|0|It's gone, man.|Halpern, Elizabeth|creator||
|*2010M-1|Annotation by A. L. (Alfred Leslie) Rowse on clipping|4/6/2018|Yes|0|It's gone, man.|Halpern, Elizabeth|subject||

## Limitations
When there are multiple types of linked records on a row, this tool will generate the cross product (i.e. every possible combination of data). This means that if you have a lot of duplicate data if you use this tool for a report that has many linked records of different type. For instance, if you had an accession that is linked to 2 deaccessions, 4 subjects, and 3 names, you would end up with 2x4x3=24 rows in your expanded CSV report. Its easy to see how this could get exessive quickly.

One way around this is to delete any columns (or change them to a different format that will not be interpreteed as JSON data) you don't need before using this tool. If, in the example above, you only really needed the data for the linked subjects in your report,  you could delete the deaccessions and names columns so that you only ended up with 4 columns for that accession in your report.

## How to Run
With python installed, run `python expand.py path/to/my_report.csv`.

This will generate `path/to/my_report_expanded.csv`.

A setup file is also provided that can be used to generate an exe with py2exe with `python setup.py py2exe`.

This exe can be run like `expand path/to/my_report.csv`.
